The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train.\n"

It allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence, mimicking the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms found in sequence-to-sequence models. Unlike cross-attention, where the query, key, and value come from different sequences, self-attention operates within a single sequence. Self-attention has proven successful in various applications such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations.'\n"
